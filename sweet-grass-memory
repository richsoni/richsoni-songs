taping up a wrinkled picture of her
on the dashboard of my van
exits all seem like a blur
i imagine us holding hands

somewhere back in sweet grass country
is a girl that is my one true love
yeah i know shes waitin for me
even though im on the run

ditched my car near devils tower
at the south dakota line
hitched a ride for several hour
found myself a vacant sign

somewhere back in sweet grass country
is a girl that is my one true love
yeah i know shes waitin for me
even though im on the run

got a job in cedar rapids
when i ran out of my cash
sweeping floors at cornell college
with a fake name on my badge

somewhere back in sweet grass country
is a girl that is my one true love
yeah i know shes waitin for me
even though im on the run

when she showed me the fourty five
i wiped her prints off, and i left mine

at trailer park in little falls
i rent a bed for a couple bucks
i wish that i could give her a call
but i dont want to press my luck

somewhere back in sweet grass country
is a girl that is my one true love
yeah i know shes waitin for me
even though im on the run
