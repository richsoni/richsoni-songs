Ill sing you a song, aint very long  
Bout an old man who never done wrong  
How he died nobody can say  
They found him dead at his desk one day  

Well the crowd they gathered one fine morn  
Round the man worked since I was born  
There at his desk he did lay  
They stopped and stared and walked their way  

Well the manager come and he started to say  
"get up, old man, or I'm dockin' your pay"  
He jabbed him once with his leather shoe  
The man stayed stucked to his desk like glue  

Well he jabbed him a again and loudly said  
Call corporate law this troop is dead  
The lawyer come and they filed a claim  
And an insurance check is what this man became  

Ive sung you a song, aint very long  
Bout an old man who never done wrong  
How he died nobody can say  
They found him dead at his desk one day
