ooo..

you ear will hear a dreary sound
when you boots have found
the path to spookytown

see, there aint no corpses in the ground
they all walk around
the streets of spookytown

all the hell hounds, chewin on a crown
there aint no pound
in spookytown

all the trains are Transylvania bound
when they zoom out
of spookytown

a black widow's webbing wound
the brides wedding gown
in spookytown

from a tomb the groom
dug up the rings of Egyptian kings
bling

the ceremony lead with a frown
from a bloody hobo clown
in spookytown

if you wander in just turn around
you wont be down
with spookytown

ooo...
