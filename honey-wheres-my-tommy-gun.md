Jump a mojito baby, put a paper plate on your head
Your a sweet shadow shirt lady, I'd like to see you when you shed
Don't you break that shillelagh mama, this aint its first award show do you dig?
That's not a skirt your wearin', that's not a skirt it's a wig

Well I was bored before it started
I was bored when it begun
I was bored when we departed
Honey, where's the tommy gun

I'm certain about your barista, I am certain it can walk
I've seen it lickin lightning bulbs, I've seen it breaking lollipops
I'm waxing and whining for you, I'm whining with my wine
I'm scared to meet your poodle, I'm scared of overtime

Well I was bored before it started
I was bored when it begun
I was bored when we departed
Honey, where's the tommy gun

The gates have been left reading, the moat has been on fire
The sky above is bleeding, its leaking on the open wire
My skin is screaming soda, fizzle for me twice
Reach behind your shoulder, put that ring on some peaty ice

Well I was bored before it started
I was bored when it begun
I was bored when we departed
Honey, where's the tommy gun

Walk with Waldo, run with Ramapo
Bulk with Bravo, piss with Pistachio
im stitching up the gutter, its fence is barely barbed
im blowin with the barley, im wading with the guard

Well I was bored before it started
I was bored when it begun
I was bored when we departed
Honey, where's the tommy gun

whos that other bottle, whos that other purse
ill make their chester waddle, ill clip them in with a hearse
im melting mandarin oranges, and pouring them in a bath
im breating pollen honey, arent you glad i did the math

Well I was bored before it started
I was bored when it begun
I was bored when we departed
Honey, where's the tommy gun

ask me to the grocers mothers, ive been there several months
his sisters and his brothers, are all a coupla runts
she pours a glass of fabric, it weaves together tight
ive found that if I wear it, it makes my nostrils bright

grow up you little angel, id like to see you snore
while wearing bark laced overcoats, your dirty little chore

Well I was bored before it started
I was bored when it begun
I was bored when we departed
Honey, where's the tommy gun
