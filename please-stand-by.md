I made my way down to the love station  
Got myself a ticket to ride  
But i was met with procrastination  
When the announcer came on the line  

Please standby  
Please standby  
Well i aint gonna lie  
Theres a delay so please standby  

I asked whats the cause of the delay honey  
Is the engine broke in need of repair  
Can i assist in any way sugar  
Do you need me to stick my wrench in there  
All she said was...  

Please standby  
Please standby  
Well i aint gonna lie  
Theres a delay so please standby  

She said this route only has one lane and theres another train stuck on the track  
I said i feel her pain, i don't mean to complain but when will it be back  
She said i don't know i cant lie  
The priorities are high  
I really will try  
Then i gave her a sigh  
As she looked in my eye  
And said until then please stand by  

Please standby  
Please standby  
Well i aint gonna lie  
Theres a delay so please standby
