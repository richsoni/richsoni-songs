title: Please Stand By
---

i made my way down to the love station  
got myself a ticket to ride  
but i was met with procrastination  
when the announcer came on the line  

please standby  
please standby  
well i aint gonna lie  
theres a delay so please standby  

i asked whats the cause of the delay honey  
is the engine broke in need of repair  
can i assist in any way sugar  
do you need me to stick my wrench in there  
all she said was...  

please standby  
please standby  
well i aint gonna lie  
theres a delay so please standby  

she said this route only has one lane and theres another train stuck on the track  
i said i feel her pain, i dont mean to complain but when will it be back  
she said i dont know i cant lie  
the priorities are high  
i really will try  
then i gave her a sigh  
as she looked in my eye  
and said until then please stand by  

please standby  
please standby  
well i aint gonna lie  
theres a delay so please standby
