My dreams came true the day that I met you
Nothing ever seemed so sure to me
I knew our love could grow if we let it
Grow to be stronger than the sea

Time moves quick
Work seems like play
When the girl of your dreams sleeps just inches away

It's safe to say my darlin' you complete me
You make the sun shine bright when I am blue
I love to hold you tight into the evening
And feel your warmth as the dawn comes into view

Time moves quick
Work seems like play
When the girl of your dreams sleeps just inches away

My dreams came true the day I met my darlin'
Nothing ever seemed so sure to me
I knew our love could fly higher than a starling
More magical than Muscle Shoals of Tennessee

Time moves quick
Work seems like play
When the girl of your dreams sleeps just inches away
