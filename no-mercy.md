dont you ever question the threats I make to you
released from my possession youll be more than black and blue
if you touch my woman, if you even pinch her knee
remember you will have to answer to me

there will be no mercy
there will be no mercy

if you mess with her ill hang you out to dry
ill drop your squirming body from the cliffs of mohr so high
ill kick you off the side rail, and send you to your tomb
and leave your soul to dusty who will haunt you with her gloom

there will be no mercy
there will be no mercy

in general, im pretty mellow guy
but if you touch my woman
ill make your mother cry
shell be calling for her baby, but she wont get no reply
shell never see you again no matter how hard she tries


there will be no mercy
there will be no mercy
