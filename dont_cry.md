dont cry
dont cry

wipe away your tears cuz its a real good year to be alive

its alright
its alright

youll wake up in the morning and forget all about tonight

she does this everytime and we dont really want to hear her wine
she comes she drinks she laughs she cries she calls a cab and says goodnight
and we dont want her to ruin our night

alright
alright

youll wake up in the morning and forget all about tonight

you do this everytime and we dont really want to hear you wine
you come you drink you laugh you cry you call a cab and say goodnight
and we dont want you to ruin our night
