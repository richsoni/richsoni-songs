once I had wings like Noah's dove
i flew up the river looked for a love

when I found her, so hard I falled
my soul it sank, like a cannon ball

Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well

One of these days and it won't be long
Call Ill call her name, and shell be gone

I remember one night, a drizzling rain
Round my heart I felt a pain

Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well

Once my baby, she loved me so
Couldn't keep her from my do'

boys, now alone at night I lie
Scarcely ever see her, nomat how hard i try

Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well

i lost my heart, to a steel cold gal
she wanted to ramble, so she shalled

she took a keepsake, to spark her memory
and theres a hole, where my heart should be

Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well
