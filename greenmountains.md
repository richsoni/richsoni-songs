title: Green Mountains  
---  

ridin along the great green mountains  
the heart of the appilation range  
I know claim the grass could be greener  
but lord today I cant complain  

One thing that i learned from these mountains  
gazin upon them covered with snow  
is show every piece green you got  
even if theres frost down below  

We could meet up in those mountains  
say we go to bennington town  
youll know it by the spike touching the sky there  
and the mountains in every direction round  

or, maybe we can meet up in rutland  
where the mountains roll up to the sky  
we could climb to see the range there  
its green nomatter how far you stretch your eye  

some peolpe may say that im crazy  
wakin at the roosters first crow  
and walking along these great mountains  
but, my reply 's some folks was born to never know
