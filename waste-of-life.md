good god, ima falling over
to the place where ive been before
cut past the bosses shoulder
hit the tracks then the liquor store

cant keep my feet from blowing
i need a paperweight to hold me down
settle to a place then im up and going
aint no work for me left in this town

e               a
hahahahahahaima waste of life

take a look, take a really good look
im just the guy youve been trying to find
there aint a job that I havent took
there aint a job for which im qualified

6 weeks is the time it takes them
for their senses to adapt to me
meanwhile, i just keep stinkin
till their noses catch up to me

e               a
hahahahahahaima waste of life

met a chick on a bus to miami
she bought me liquor and she bought me food
she put me up in her masters pantry
it was strange but I couldnt be rude

met a chick at a bar in LA
i bail her out and she bails me too
i left once, but she cant keep me away
we drink port till our brains are stew
