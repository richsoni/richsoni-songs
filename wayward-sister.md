hard luck dont go down easy
it seizes up your wits
but, i promise aint sleazy
to hack it up to bits

those that leave it up to Nature
to bargain Fortune in their name
often justify the torture
often revel in the shame

wayward sister, get up off the floor
wayward sister, step out the door

woke up between 1 and 2
who are you kidding, you never fell asleep
in the tips of your fingers you can feel the doom
being laughed at by the sheep

cooking, cleaning, smiling, scheming, breathing
in a chicken room takes a toll
youve spent years of daydreaming
chasing the fox out of its hole

wayward sister, get up off the floor
wayward sister, step out the door

hitched up the hogs about a million times
yet what is there to show
move to town, drop all your dimes
rush down there to earn some more

we can smell it when you enter
dont deny the utter truth
youve been made over by a blender
youve been howling to the moon

wayward sister, get up off the floor
wayward sister, step out the door

hard luck doesnt go down easy
it suffocates your brain
but, i promise aint sleazy
to runaway from all the pain

nestle with us in the forest
we eat and sing all of the time
live like a transendentalistic tourist
is being happy such a crime?

wayward sister, get up off the floor
wayward sister, step out the door
