When I bought that house and ship, I was young and full of zip,  
 left my parents, and my friends in old Bayonne.  
And so I made the race, and i stacked me out a place  
And settled down along a tidal zone  

It flowed away, it flowed away  
My little seaside home it flowed away  
I was living on a prayer when i built my shanty there.  
Everything except my mortgage flowed away  

I got this broken boat, and i fixed it up to float  
Aimed to have sawmill slice to feed my face  
When i was done i tied the bow to the dock outside the house  
And i knew that i had finally found my place  

It flowed away, it flowed away  
That ship that i fixed up flowed away  
When the Atlantic had its panic it went down like the titanic  
All the pieces of my ship they flowed away  

My bananner stand, lost to the roving sand  
The stock is probably down in old VA  
All the cash inside sailed down route 35  
My Banana  shop in seaside flowed away  

It flowed away, it flowed away  
Everything I owned flowed away  
I hollered and I cussed when my stand went with a thrust  
When my business that I own, it flowed away  

I was living on a prayer when i built my shanty there.  
I figured I was all set for all my life.  
So up hopped into my woody and went looking for a goody  
But, i found myself a puggle, and not a wife  

He flowed away, he flowed away  
My jersey shore pup he flowed away  
I leaned on down to pet him, but i saw that he could swim  
My jersey shore puggle flowed away  

Then I was left alone a-listenin' to the moan  
Of the sea around the corners of my shack  
So I took off down the road when the ocean water flowed  
A-travelin' with the waves cracking at my back  

I flowed away, I flowed away  
Mataloking bridge was up ahead  
I was living on a prayer as I saw my shanty tear  
My house its settled in the ocean bed  

Now I'm always close to home no matter where I roam,  
For those waters spread all across the land  
Makes no difference where I'm walkin', I can hear my ship a-rockin'  
I can hear that puggle a-barkin' in the air  

It flowed away,  it flowed away  
My little seaside home it flowed away  
But my home is always near; its in the waters clear  
My little seaside home it flowed away  

I'm a writ of right New Jersyite, but we don't need to reunite   
And Ill never get homesick 'til I die.  
No matter where I'm found, my home is all around;  
My seaside home is wherever it rains, or water lies  

It flowed away, it flowed away,  
My shanty down at exit 82  
But all around the world, wherever sand is whirled  
Some is what my seaside home broke into  

It flowed away, it flowed away,  
My little seaside home it flowed away  
Its over in the sea where the waves are rolling free  
My little seaside home it flowed away
