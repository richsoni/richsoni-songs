title: Man On The Desk
---

ill sing you a song, aint very long
bout an old man who never done wrong
how he died nobody can say
they found him dead at his desk one day

well the crowd they gathered one fine morn
round the man worked sice hws born
there at his desk he did lay
they stopped and stared and walked their way

well the manager come and he started to say
"get up, old man, or im dockin your pay"
he jabbed him once with his leather shoe
the man stayed stucked to his desk like glue

well he jabbed him a again and loudly said
call corporate law this troop is dead
the lawer come and they filed a claim
and an insurance check is what this man became

ive sung you a song, aint very long
bout an old man who never done wrong
how he died nobody can say
they found him dead at his desk one day
