Up in the morning chasing the dawn
20 pound hammer slung over my arm
Casey don't wait when your late for the train
Seventeen miles in the drizzling rain

Walking up to the foreman
He hollers and cusses at you
When your late to Dockery Farms
It makes you sing The Workingman's Blues

My woman's an artist, shes paining the town
Spends all the harvest on dresses and gowns
maybe someday though we'll save up a buck
but, I'm chained to the cane till I change my luck

With hands slipping into your pocket
The taxes and mortgage are due
Your shelling out sixty two grand for a handful
Of The Workingman's Blues

My best friends a bottle of Tennessee Red
Pouring it over the webs on my bed
Rollin & tumbling all night long
Then its up in the morning chasing the dawn

Counting the stars from the awning
Blowing a rusty kazoo
Trying to drown the sound of
In your head called The Workingman's Blues
