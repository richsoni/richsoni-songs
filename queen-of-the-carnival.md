The summer breeze was blowing All the hair out of my eyes
dunking the vice principal, slugging pilfered booze with the guys
thats when I saw her standing there
I couldn't be more surprised
she was looking like the queen of the carnival that night

I won her heart slugging leapfrogs high into the air
i never landed her that aweful looking pink teddy bear
im sure it was implied and we didnt seem to care
just entertainment for me and the queen of the carnival that night

we gazed into the reflection
in the twisted funhouse meer
the backdrop is a cover band playing the songs we love to hear
on the scrambler my stomach turned with butterflies and fear
with my arm around the queen of the carnival that night

i kissed her under lights of yellow blue and red
the green grass of the football field was our temporary bed
as the fireworks exploded high above our head
i watched them with the queen of the carnival that night
