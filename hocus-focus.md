title: Hocus Focus
---

when she puts her hocus focus on me  
you be sure im in jeopardy  
or at least in store for some misery  
when shes hocus focused on me  

when shes hocus focused on you  
good luck enjoying chicken cordon blue  
your pulse will bubble while you struggle to chew  
when she puts that hocus focus on you  

that hocus focus it can smell  
when you been swimming the royal canal  
shell jingle jange a triangle and blow into a conch shell  
makin sure you keep away from the swell  

her hocus focus can hear  
your breath as it trebles with fear  
when she grabs your horns and tries to steer  
thats hocus focus for you dear  

her hocus focus can feel  
when you try to squirm from her like an eel  
dont try because youll cry when she pulls you by her achilles heel  
she got you hooked by her reel  

her hocus focus intercepts your every thought  
every electric kilawatt  
shell come in and she'll swat you while your lying on your cot  
if you have a plot she'll tie you into a knot  

her hocus focus will forever roast  
your name, your family, and your ghost  
forget ever being in any kind of toast  
even in your casket shell be close  
with her hocus focus, her hocus focus, her hocus focus
