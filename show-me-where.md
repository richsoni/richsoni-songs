i gave my lovin i gave it to you
i thought us two where stuck like glue
but then you packed your things and said so long
baby, wont you show me where I went wrong

buying roses by the boquet
a box of chocolates on valentines day
in the card, i wrote you a song
baby, wont you show me where i went wrong

i took you swimmin in south caroline
you drank your mojito your drank your wine
we sat on the beach all day long
baby, wont you show me where i went wrong

i built a fire, we lay on the rug
i gave my kiss, i gave my hug
the heat it was oh so strong
baby, wont you show me where i went wrong
