Ive got a hound that hasn't howled for a second in her life  
Ive got a hound that hasn't howled for a second in her life  
So, I took her to the doctor, to make sure everything is alright  

Well he had her stick out her tongue and listened to her breathe  
He felt her pulse beat, while he looked at the watch below his sleeve  
Then I said tell me great doctor, are there any issues you perceive  

He said the hound she is a healthy flower  
Theres not an issue I can see  
don't forget to pay the front counter  
Two hundred forty five dollars and 88 cents before you leave  
So I left a little lighter, but no smarter wouldn't you agree?  

Ive got a hound that hasn't howled for a second in her life  
Ive got a hound that hasn't howled for a second in her life  
So, I took her to the doctor, to make sure everything is alright  

But, the doctor was useless, and he charged me an arm and a leg  
So, I tried my luck with a dog gypsy, to see if she would be the one to peg  
Down the cause if this issue, find my hounds easter egg  

She put her hand on the hounds ears, and looked both their black eyes met  
She saw into my hounds soul, but when she looked back at me began to fret  
She seems happy as a clam my friend, before you leave pay off your debt  

One hundred fifty two dollars and fifty cents!!!  

Ive got a hound that hasn't howled for a second in her life  
Ive got a hound that hasn't howled for a second in her life  
So, I took her to the doctor, and a pet gypsy to make sure everything is alright  

On the bus ride home, a met a witch doctor and the two of us started to chat  
He charged me 25 dollars to brew a tea within his hat  
He said she clearly has a sore throat, and this is the cure for that  

...it goes without saying that it didn't work  

Ive got a hound that hasn't howled for a second in her life  
Ive got a hound that hasn't howled for a second in her life  
So, I took her to the doctor, a pet gypsy, and a witch doctor see if everything is alright  

When the witch doctor left, a men in a orange sari came and sat down  
He had a face that looked exotic, and not a single hair upon his crown  
He said my desperate friend I know why you dog aint makin' a sound  

She took a vow of silence, to live the Buddhist way  
She watches life pass by and looks out the window each and everyday  
She wants you to give all your money to the Buddhist monetary  

Ive got a hound that hasn't howled for a second in her life  
Ive got a hound that hasn't howled for a second in her life  
It took a doctor, pet gypsy, witch doctor, and a monk to why she aint alright  

I gave into the monk and donated my money, and now we both live life without a strife
