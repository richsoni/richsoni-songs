title: Hound Dog Blues
---

ive got a hound that hasnt howled for a second in her life
ive got a hound that hasnt howled for a second in her life
so, i took her to the doctor, to make sure everything is alright

well he had her stick out her tounge and listened to her breathe
he felt her pulse beat, while he looked at the watch below his sleeve
then I said tell me great doctor, are there any issues you perceive

he said the hound she is a healthy flower
theres not an issue i can see
dont forget to pay the front counter
two hundred fourty five dollars and 88 cents before you leave
so I left a little lighter, but no smarter wouldnt you agree?

ive got a hound that hasnt howled for a second in her life
ive got a hound that hasnt howled for a second in her life
so, i took her to the doctor, to make sure everything is alright

but, the doctor was useless, and he charged me an arm and a leg
so, i tried my luck with a dog gypsy, to see if she would be the one to peg
down the cause if this issue, find my hounds easter egg

she put her hand on the hounds ears, and looked both their black eyes met
she saw into my hounds soul, but when she looked back at me began to fret
she seems happy as a clam my friend, before you leave pay off your debt

one hundred fifty two dollars and fifty cents!!!

(solo)

ive got a hound that hasnt howled for a second in her life
ive got a hound that hasnt howled for a second in her life
so, i took her to the doctor, and a pet gypsy to make sure everything is alright

on the bus ride home, a met a witch doctor and the two of us started to chat
he charged me 25 dollars to brew a tea within his hat
he said she clearly has a sore throat, and this is the cure for that

...it goes without saying that it didnt work

ive got a hound that hasnt howled for a second in her life
ive got a hound that hasnt howled for a second in her life
so, i took her to the doctor, a pet gypsy, and a witch doctor see if everything is alright

when the witch doctor left, a men in a orange sari came and sat down
he had a face that looked exotic, and not a single hair upon his crown
he said my desperate friend I know why you dog aint makin a sound

she took a vow of silence, to live the buddhist way
she watches life pass by and looks out the window each and everyday
she wants you to give all your money to the buddhist monestary

ive got a hound that hasnt howled for a second in her life
ive got a hound that hasnt howled for a second in her life
it took a doctor, pet gypsy, witch doctor, and a monk to why she aint alright

i gave into the monk and donated my money, and now we both live life without a strife
