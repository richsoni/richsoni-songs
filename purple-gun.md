swa---yng within the cane on the brazos
drank tequilla till im blotto
knocked down to the ground by the stun o'the sun
my aim first met the frame of the purple gun

pla----ying stud in the parlor
queeeeeennnn found a coula partners
shoot for the loot, but the table spun
but a drunk cant handle to gamble gainst the purple gun

ri-----din for el dorado
na-----thin can stop you
but thats alright boy while you run
your bella dance with the fella with the purple gun


peeyyyyote powow
heeeyyyyy who stole my eyebrows
tappin a shoe to the siouxes drum
thum never stammers from the hammer of the purple gun

filled with bravado
duel with the yabbo
he said nettle my mood and it wont be fun
but, the last thing he guzzled was the muzzle of the purple gun
