some say life is the shadow of our dreams
dreams are just shadows of the soul
so it seems that the dead in the stream
are just floating down to get speared by the troll

how long must i wait to meet my doom
listening to the rain
watching the lightning in the sky
but thats life in the tower of cain

oh myself, myself, i must trust myself
i know that it has to be done
got a ladder, took my gun off of the shelf
sent a message, saying brother you must come

how long must i wait to meet my doom
listening to the rain
watching the lightning in the sky
but thats life in the tower of cain

some say life is just a brief drop of time
aim the gun, pull the trigger, smell the spark
as it cools, all i have left is a sigh
all alone, like a stone in the dark
