title: Born To Live
---

some people was born, to workin every day
others are there to take the workers pain away
They could tell a good joke, or sing a good song
its hard to say if ones is right or ones wrong

some people want to make you give, give, give
but not me, babe
baby, I was born to live

some where born, to never leave the city
at the foot of buildings touching the sky
other ones, live a life so gritty
they never wore a suit or tie

some people want to make you give, give, give
but not me,
baby, I was born to live

i aint lookin to yak yak yak
fear the future and regret the past

ill eat when im hungry and sleep where i lay
ill do what i want and live till i die

some people want to make you give, give, give
but not me,
baby, I was born to live

once more,

some people want to make you give, give, give
but not me,
baby, I was born to live
