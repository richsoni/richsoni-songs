how come you dont get along with me
how come you dont get along with me
you dont even show a trace, of geniality
how come you dont get along with me

how come you try to make me cry
how come you try to make me cry
you work on my face until breaking my eye
how come you try to make me cry

how come you never say hello
how come you never say hello
you always race right past my window
how come you never say hello

how come you always acting smug
how come you always acting smug
your the opposite of grace, i have never seen you shrug
how come you always acting smug

how come you make my wanna punch yo lip
how come you make my wanna punch yo lip
ill whack you with a mace, ill give your shirt a rip
how come you make my want to punch your lip
