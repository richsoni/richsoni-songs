the undertoe
underneath our toes
will pull us far
from the life we know

all of our dreams
happy they seem
reality screams
screams so loud

lets get deserted baby
on a desert i-hi-hi-isle
maybe then we could be
alone for a whi-hi-hi-ile

coconuts
nipa hut
would be all
all that we need

the salt in the air
flowers in your hair
nothing to wear
but a smile

lets get deserted baby
on a desert i-hi-hi-isle
maybe then we could be
alone for a whi-hi-hi-ile

the salt in the air
flowers in your hair
nothing to wear
but a smile

all of our dreams
happy they seem
reality screams
screams so loud

lets get deserted baby
on a desert i-hi-hi-isle
maybe then we could be
alone for a whi-hi-hi-ile
