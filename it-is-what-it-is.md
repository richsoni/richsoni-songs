title: It Is What It Is
---

i get a low down feeling
thinkin bout all the evil that i see
theres people dying
just tryin to be free

this aint a world
to raise kids
but, it is what it is

im just doin me
tryin to keep on keepin on
all the news that i see
lookin a lot like the letters of john

this aint a world
in the angels biz
but, it is what it is

theres darkness everywhere
its even got your neighbors kid
obody wants to care
nobody wants to whatd happen if they did

this aint a world
that needs another destruction wiz
but, it is what it is

haters gonna hate
gonna hate their way into a war
the angel at heavens gate will be
all like what was it you where fighting for?

this aint a world
where it should be mine or his
but, it is what it is

this aint a world
prepared for the final quiz
but, it is what it is
