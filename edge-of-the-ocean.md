are you here upside down
well, we're living on the edge of the ocean
with the mocking rumble ready to drown
oh the breeze climbs over my window
with all the ocean round
well then i wakeup every morning
brother brother wasnt looking down
let me tell you brother it wont be when the seagull cross over town
s'acrawlin against my window
i lean my head today
with all the headings i follow
hundred down that gate
well, weather will give no warning
well open your head to the ground
let me tell you brother its coming when the seagulls cross over town
