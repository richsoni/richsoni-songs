hey baby doll, how you livin
you work here in the mall sellin care for skin?
its just funny our last conversation
you said you could design fashion in berlin

howdy jack, tell me whats good
ten years ago you always could
now your a carpenter gluing wood
you wife left you for some robin hood

some people are just a dying fad
once they leave there moms and their dads
and they find the want ads
want someone in stripes but they only bought plaid

hows it shakin dutchess, (peck on cheek)
its been a minute since i heard you squeek
who woulda though you hit your peak
you 26 and you neglect your physicque

hey buddy, put er there
hows americas favorite teddy bear
where is your beard you look like a square
looks like corporate hunters caught you in there snare

some people are just a dying fad
once they leave there moms and their dads
and they find the want ads
want someone in stripes but they only bought plaid

the only thing i say bought myself
is indeed i know the value of health and wealth
and i know my likes change with the seasons
but i always move forward to find my meaning

and know to answer only to me
requires dottin your own i's and crossin' your tees
you need to pedal your own bike without skiddin your knee
to live my life as a man thats free
