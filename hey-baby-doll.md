Hey baby doll, how you livin'  
You work here in the mall sellin' care for skin?  
Its just funny our last conversation  
You said you could design fashion in Berlin  

Howdy jack, tell me whats good  
Ten years ago you always could  
Now your a carpenter gluing wood  
You wife left you for some robin hood  

Some people are just a dying fad  
Once they leave there moms and their dads  
And they find the want ads  
Want someone in stripes but they only bought plaid  

Hows it shakin' dutches, (peck on cheek)  
Its been a minute since I heard you squeak  
Who woulda though you hit your peak  
You 26 and you neglect your physique  

Hey buddy, put er there  
Hows Americas favorite teddy bear  
Where is your beard you look like a square  
Looks like corporate hunters caught you in there snare  

Some people are just a dying fad  
Once they leave there moms and their dads  
And they find the want ads  
Want someone in stripes but they only bought plaid  

The only thing I say bought myself  
Is indeed I know the value of health and wealth  
And I know my likes change with the seasons  
But I always move forward to find my meaning  

And know to answer only to me  
Requires dottin' your own i's and crossin' your tees  
You need to pedal your own bike without skiddin' your knee  
To live my life as a man thats free
