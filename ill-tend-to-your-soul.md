title: Ill Tend To Your Soul
---

When your clock it stops a-tickin''  
And its time for you to go  
When your clock it stops a-tickin'  
Brother I want you to know  

If a crow is at your window  
Ill be sittin' by your bed  
Forget that crow upon your window  
Focus on my singing instead  

Don't you worry about nobody  
Ill keep everything in control  
While there tending to your body  
Ill tend to your soul  

When your days are getting numbered  
When your weary to your toe  
When your days are getting numbered  
Brother I want you to know  

Depart with a tranquil feeling  
Live this moment as you wish  
Depart with a tranquil feeling  
Before you flip off that switch  


Ill make sure the angels get it  
To induct you to their shoal  
Brother don't you fret it  
Ill tend to your soul  

Ill bring it every where with me  
Until its time to hand it off  
Ill bring it every where with me  
making sure its never lost  

It'll rest right next to mine  
I know theres room in there for both  
They'll be there intertwined  
Ill tend to your soul
