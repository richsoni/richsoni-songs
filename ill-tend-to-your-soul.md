title: Ill Tend To Your Soul
---

E                     A
when your clock it stops a-tickin
E                     B
and its time for you to go
E                     A
when your clock it stops a-tickin
B                     E
brother i want you to know

if a crow is at your winder
ill be sittin by your bed
forget that crow upon yer winder
focus on my singin instead

dont you worry about nobody
ill keep everything in control
while there tending to your body
ill tend to your soul

----

when your days are getting numbered
when your weary to yer toe
when your days are getting numbered
brother i want you to know

depart with a tranquil feeling
live this moment as you wish
depart with a tranquil feeling
before you flip off that switch


ill make sure the angels get it
to induct you to their shoal
brother dont you fret it
ill tend to your soul

----

ill bring it every where with me
until its time to hand it off
ill bring it every where with me
making sure its never lost

itl rest right next to mine
i know theres room in there for both
theyll be there intertwined
ill tend to your soul
