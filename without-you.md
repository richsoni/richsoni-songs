I'd walk a couple hundred miles
with no shoes, limping all the while
trade all my remaining smiles
to live without you

I'd forget everything i knew
I'd push you out of my minds view
I'd do everything i could do
to live without you

But I don't
Cause I know
That it aint no use
to even try
to say goodbye
so, i stay right in your view
right here, chained up to you

I'd stop doing all the things I love
I'd pray to gods up above
give a rattlesnake a shove
to live without you

id sell off all of my coats
my book of oscar wilde quotes
buy me a ticket for a boat
to live without you

But I don't
Cause I know
That it aint no use
to even try
to say goodbye
so, i stay right in your view
right here, chained up to you

id erase in all of my songs
all them catchy sing alongs
admit that im always wrong
to live without you

I'd sit up all of the night
never seen the sun shining bright
you couldnt even beat me in a fight
if the prize was
living without you

But I don't
Cause I know
That it aint no use
to even try
to say goodbye
so, i stay right in your view
right here, chained up to you
