### Lyrics

well its 11 oclock on a saturday prowl
lookin for a  lover with a penetrating smile
ill keep my hands to myself, gee you feel so nice

Hey, let me take youuuuuuuuuu to a basement
Youll look so exotic in the neon light
Babe, youll get a hot pink paper bracelet
itl Bring out the blue in your eyes tonight

got your hip tattoo of an upside down cross
diggin the way your riding on the evening bus
come along if you trust me, but i wont ask you twice

Hey, let me take youuuuuuuuuuo a basement
Youll look so exotic in the neon light
Babe, youll get a hot pink paper bracelet
itl Bring out the blue in your eyes tonight

we could pound back a few, i know itl warm us up
forget that new movie, forget that expensive night club
i know a place itl be just alright, but if you dont wanna come i wont put up i fight

Hey, let me take youuuuuuuuuu to a basement
Youll look so exotic in the neon light
Babe, youll get a hot pink paper bracelet
itl Bring out the blue in your eyes tonight
