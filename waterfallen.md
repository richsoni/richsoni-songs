well, I fell into a river
I slipped into a stream
my face began to shiver
it was cold I had to scream

baby screeching to help me out
shes reaching for my shoulder
but in me theres not a doubt
that ill pull her off that boulder

I claw at leaves dirt and clovers
im sure my time has come to me
but paws, sleaves fill, spurting over
then i see the tree

well, I fell into a river
I slipped into a stream
up the shaley cliff i slither
crawling up a cedar beam

my jacket and my rucksack
my blue jeans and my boots
are soaked with mossy plaque
and nodding beggertick roots

everything had to come off
or I would get bronchitis or the flu
i didnt want to get a cough
plus my fingers where turning blue

well, I fell into a river
I slipped into a stream
cutting jeans off with a scissor
testing self esteem

everything in my posession
soaked in this whole charade
i lost it all to a lesson
for a view of a cascade

all the signs where clearly shown
right before my ignorant eyes
i heeded none, and to atone
i lost all my supplies

well, I fell into a river
I slipped into a stream
I fell into a river
it all seemed like a dream
