g      am       c           g
i cant tell you where where going
g      c         d        g
i cant say where well end up
g      am       c           g
like doves in the wind a blowin
g      c         d        g
searching for a place to slump

but if its true life has a meaning
locked in a safe by eternity
understand theres no machining
that can replace the swallowed key

c                          g  f#
my advise is to stop searching
c                          g  am
and to come wander with me
c            g  f#   e
our paths our surly merging
c              d
so come wander with me

babe the big and yazoo river
never ponder or expect
instead, its gravity that delivers
them to the place where they connect

and the water flowing downward
may be headed toward the sea
yet a lake that it encounters
may be where it wants to be

my advise is to stop searching
and to come wander with me
our paths our surly merging
so come wander with me

so if you want to walk together
i welcome you with an open hand
im sure well face all kinds of weather
but as one we will stand

my advise is to stop searching
and to come wander with me
our paths our surly merging
so come wander with me
