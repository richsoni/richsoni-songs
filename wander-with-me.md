i cant tell you where where going  
i cant say where well end up  
like doves in the wind a blowin  
searching for a place to slump  

but if its true life has a meaning  
locked in a safe by eternity  
understand theres no machining  
that can replace the swallowed key  

my advise is to stop searching  
and to come wander with me  
our paths our surly merging  
so come wander with me  

babe the big and yazoo river  
never ponder or expect  
instead, its gravity that delivers  
them to the place where they connect  

and the water flowing downward  
may be headed toward the sea  
yet a lake that it encounters  
may be where it wants to be  

my advise is to stop searching  
and to come wander with me  
our paths our surly merging  
so come wander with me  

so if you want to walk together  
i welcome you with an open hand  
im sure well face all kinds of weather  
but as one we will stand  

my advise is to stop searching  
and to come wander with me  
our paths our surly merging  
so come wander with me
