I'm a rambler, programmer  
I'm a long ways from home  
And if you don't like me then leave me alone  
Ill work when I'm bored, and ill sleep when i lie  
And if coding don't kill me ill live till i die  

When I left me college I was a poor boy  
I worked at a start up, and lived on la choy  
When the start up got bought, I sold all me stock  
And now if you look at my check book it'll give you a shock  

I'm a rambler, programmer  
I'm a long ways from home  
And if you don't like me then leave me alone  
Ill work when I'm bored, and ill sleep when i lie  
And if coding don't kill me ill live till i die  

Waiting at the station I see a man in a suit  
He looks at my flannel and scowls at my boots  
He grins to my face and i frown and give him a salute  

I'm a rambler, programmer  
I'm a long ways from home  
And if you don't like me then leave me alone  
Ill work when I'm bored, and ill sleep when i lie  
And if coding don't kill me ill live till i die  

Programming, programming oh i cherish you  
If not for your power id be just as blue  
As all of the slickers, and noobs who work so very slow  
It wrinkles their skin and dulls off their glow  

I'm a rambler, programmer  
I'm a long ways from home  
And if you don't like me then leave me alone  
Ill work when I'm bored, and ill sleep when i lie  
And if coding don't kill me ill live till i die
