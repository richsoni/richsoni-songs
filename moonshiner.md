Im a rambler, programmer
Im a long ways from home
and if you dont like me then leave me alone
Ill work when im bored, and ill sleep when i lie
and if coding dont kill me ill live till i die

when I left me college I was a poor boy
I worked at a start up, and lived on la choy
when the start up got bought, I sold all me stock
and now if you look at my check book itl give you a shock

Im a rambler, programmer
Im a long ways from home
and if you dont like me then leave me alone
Ill work when im bored, and ill sleep when i lie
and if coding dont kill me ill live till i die

Waiting at the station I see a man in a suit
he looks at my flannel and scowles at my boots
he grins to my face and i frown and give him a salute

Im a rambler, programmer
Im a long ways from home
and if you dont like me then leave me alone
Ill work when im bored, and ill sleep when i lie
and if coding dont kill me ill live till i die

programming, programming oh i cherish you
if not for your power id be just as blue
as all of the slickers, and noobs who work so very slow
it wrinkles their skin and dulls off their glow

Im a rambler, programmer
Im a long ways from home
and if you dont like me then leave me alone
Ill work when im bored, and ill sleep when i lie
and if coding dont kill me ill live till i die
