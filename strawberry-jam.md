Strawberry jam in my bed
smeared upon a slice of wonder bread

wonder i neednt as I wean it toward my head
of the allure it has when its spread

#>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Strawberry jam when im squealing bored
just a little lick and im feeling cured

not a thing is like the tart and sweet taste
both when its bare or when its laced

#$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Strawberry jam upon my lips
i scoop it with my fingertips

Like a honey sucklin' bear
i can smell its fragrance in the air

#**************************************

so i heard she wants to hang with me
come with that jam by the snoozin tree

hey girl did you hear about what I like
feed me some jam and you can ride my bike
