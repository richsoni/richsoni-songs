'When I bought that house and ship, I was young and full of zip,'
'I left my parents, and my friends in old bayonne.'
'and so I made the race, and i stacked me out a place'
'and settled down along a tidal zone'

'It flowed away, it flowed away'
'my little seaside home it flowed away'
'i was living on a prayer when i built my shanty there.'
'everything except my mortgage flowed away'

'i got this broken boat, and i fixed it up to float'
'aimed to have sawmill slice to feed my face'
'when i was done i tied the bow to the dock outside the house'
'and i knew that i had finally found my place'

'It flowed away, it flowed away'
'that ship that i fixed up flowed away'
'when the atlantic had its panic it went down like the titanic'
'all the pieces of my ship they flowed away'

'my bananner stand, lost to the roving sand'
'the stock is probly down in old v.a'
'all the cash inside sailed down route 35'
'my bananna shop in seaside flowed away'

'it flowed away, it flowed away'
'Everything I owned flowed away'
'I hollered and I cussed when my stand went with a thrust'
'when my business that I own, it flowed away'

'i was living on a prayer when i built my shanty there.'
'I figured I was all set for all my life.'
'so up hopped into my woody and went lookin for a goodie'
'but, i found myself a puggle, and not a wife'

'he flowed away, he flowed away'
'my jersey shore pup he flowd away'
'i leaned on down to pet him, but i saw that he could swim'
'my jersey shore puggle flowed away'

'Then I was left alone a-listenin to the moan'
'of the sea around the corners of my shack'
'so I took off down the road when the ocean water flowd'
'a travelin with the waves cracking at my back'

'I flowed away, I flowed away'
'mataloking bridge was up ahead'
'i was living on a prayer as I saw my shanty tear'
'my house its settled in the ocean bed'

'Now Im always close to home no matter where I roam,'
'for those waters spread all across the land'
'Makes no difference where Im walkin, I can hear my ship a-rockin'
'I can hear that puggle a-barkin in the air'

'it flowed away,  it flowed away'
'my little seaside home it flowed away'
'but my home is always near; its in the waters clear'
'my little seaside home it flowed away'

'Im a writ of right new jersyite, but we dont need to ruinite' 
'And Ill never get homesick til I die.'
'No matter where Im found, my home is all around;'
'My seaside home is wherever it rains, or water lies'

'it flowed away, it flowed away,'
'my shanty down at exit 82'
'But all around the world, wherever sand is whirled'
'Some is what my seaside home broke into'

'it flowed away, it flowed away,'
'my little seaside home it flowed away'
'its over in the sea where the waves are rolling free'
'my little seaside home it flowed away'
