not a coat of many colors, gold frankensense or mirh
not a hundred thousand dollars, or a ship of tiger furs
Not a jeanies wishes granted: four or three or two
not even an enchantment, to keep the sky above me blue

baby
cant you see
i know you dont always believe it
but, your the greatest gift that can be

not leading a million soldiers, with an aristeia glow
not the world falling on my shoulders, saving it from a lethal blow
not an archemides lever, makin me extra strong,
not living for forever, unless you could come along

baby
cant you see
i know you dont always believe it
but, your the greatest gift that can be

not having some sart of mozart, write me a set of quartets
not my nemesis falling short, in a game of russian roulette
not speaking toungues of every culture, hawaian, wolof, and thai
not a copper plated sculpture, 150 storeys high

baby
cant you see
i know you dont always believe it
but, your the greatest gift that can be
