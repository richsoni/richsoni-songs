I'm just a man
An ordinary man
Made out of muscle and blood

Found me a girl
An angel of a girl
Came from the stars above

I took her dancing by a river that I know
We were dancing neath her naitive moonlight glow
Cuz when an ordinary man finds himself an angel
he'd be a fool to let her go

I mined me a stone
no ordinary stone
the rarest stone in the land

set it in a ring
a golden ring
and put onto her right hand

I took her dancing by a river that I know
We were dancing neath her naitive moonlight glow
Cuz when an ordinary man finds himself an angel
he'd be a fool to let her go

im just a man
an ordinary man
made out of water and mud

found me a girl
an angel of a girl
Came from the stars above
