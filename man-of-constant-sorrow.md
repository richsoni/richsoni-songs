title: Man Of Constant Sorrow
---

i am a man of constant sorrow  
ive seen trouble all my days  
ill say goodbye to old towaco  
where i was born and partly raised  

through this open world im bound and shambled  
stuck in a corporate ladder game  
im about to ride that morning railroad  
perhaps ill die upon that train  

they say my jobs in danger  
if i dont work some more  
but heres one promise too ya  
5pm and im out the door  

im going back to old towaco  
the place i started from  
if i knowed how bad theyd treat me  
babe i never woulda come
