I am a man of constant sorrow  
I've seen trouble all my days  
I'll say goodbye to old Towaco  
Where I was born and partly raised  

Through this open world I'm bound and shambled  
Stuck in a corporate ladder game  
I'm about to ride that morning railroad  
Perhaps I'll die upon that train  

They say my jobs in danger  
If i don't work some more  
But heres one promise too ya  
5pm and I'm out the door  

I'm going back to old Towaco  
The place I started from  
If I knowed how bad they'd treat me  
Babe, I never woulda come
