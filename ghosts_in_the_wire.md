title: Ghost In The Wire
---

well theres ghosts in the wire, ma. listeneng when I speak
oh, theres ghosts in the wire, ma. listenen when I do speak
it feels like a snitch
a coward or a freak

theres a sound neath my bed, ma
I feel like I cant get down
oh theres a sound neath my bed, ma
I dont want to try to get down
Get this monster out of my room
I dont want him around

well theres eyes in my window, ma
watching while I sleep
oh, theres eyes in the window, ma
watching while I sleep
well it might be osiris 
judging all my sheep

theres a ghoul in the closet, ma
looking to find some bones
oh, theres a ghoul in the closet, ma
trying to score some bones
well, there aint no bones round here
but, if there was they should levem alone

theres movement in my curtain, ma
and, tonight there aint no wind
my curtain is a movin, ma
and, tonight theres not single gust of wind
I pray it aint a vampire
tryin to get me pinned

theres a witch in the tree, ma
laughing when I cry
oh theres a witch in the tree, ma
she laughs each time I cry
when I ask her whats so funny,
she looks back real sly and says stop bein shy
