Ima red tied minstrel, roamin from town to town
Ima red tied minstrel, watch out when around
uncles better hide your nieces, when you hear my sound

If you see me with your nieces, you gummed up steps ago
If you see me with your nieces, ill raise defience pent deep below
Ill bring them to your window, but its them that will take the stones and throw

Ima red tied minstrel, cocked hat lookin sharp
Ima red tied minstrel, blowin my silver harp
I wont be stickin round here long, pretty soon ill be in other parts

If you see me with your nieces, pray it aint the last time you do
If you see me with your nieces, pray they dont come along with my crew
dont you go blamin it on me, they just lookin for an excuse

Ima red tied minstrel, roamin from town to town
Ima red tied minstrel, watch out when around
uncles better hide your nieces, when you hear my sound
