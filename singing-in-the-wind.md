Did you smell the roses in the air?
Did you smell the roses in the air?
Yes, with my feet above the square
I couldn't even bear
the smell of all the roses in the air

Did you see it written in the stone?
Did you see it written in the stone?
Yes, I stood there all alone
Till after grass had grown
All the while staring at the stone

Cant you hear the singing in the wind?
Cant you hear the singing in the wind?
Yes, each night I do spend
hearing songs that never end
Coming in my window with the wind

Is it still against you to believe?
Is it still against you to believe?
I would be talking through my teeth
from my skin to deep beneath
if I promised you that I do believe
