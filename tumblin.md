when the limelite is shining
while the king of clubs is dining
at the 5 star joint, and the shift lead has appointed
you who has no clue how to do a waiters job
you trip over your shoe and spill the glue colored stew
and the kings cold black eyes stare right through your taboo
but dont you feel blue, jack

everybody has had a ball that they fumbled
everybodys been a rock on the tumble
so, next time you see somebody walkin take a stumble
just try to be humble
we all see trouble

when tweedle dee begins to hum a drum beat
he taps his feet, and the side of his seat with the meat of his thumb
and as he goes numb the gum shoots from
his rum gullett onto the back of your mullet
but neither your nor him should feel dumb
when your at your interview you notice and feel like a bum

everybody has had a ball that they fumbled
everybodys been a rock on the tumble
so, next time you see somebody walkin take a stumble
just try to be humble
we all see trouble

when that lonesome whistle sounds and the train is leaving town
and you start to make a frown because on a whim you left tiny tim
back at the station dont worry jim
yuo where just hurryin

everybody has had a ball that they fumbled
everybodys been a rock on the tumble
so, next time you see somebody walkin take a stumble
just try to be humble
we all see trouble
