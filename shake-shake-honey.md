Well your, mother knows but shes turned her head
Your father dont cuz you'd end up dead
and now you find yourself crawling out your window
when its time to go to bed
oh shake shake it honey wont you shake yourself down the ledge

You got a driver hes got cash to spend
he says he loves you but you dont even pretend
he takes to a disco and you go lookin for a friend
shake shake it honey looks like hes home alone again

a teacher caught you when your where skippin class
to head downtown to work your sass
but you said he could come with you if he wrote you up a pass
shake shake it honey shake it down the grass

well the people whisper all around the town
how you wear the moonlight as your evening gown
but dont you listen to the baby
they cant prove whats going down
shake shake it honey shake it all around
