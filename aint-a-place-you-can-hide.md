nuclear bombs blowin' venomous air
feel that fallout dust getting stuck in my hair
looking for safety, lookin for a place to survive
but in this whole damn world, there aint a place you can hide

history books dont tell it so well
see, this whole damn world is a living hell
mountains of people everywhere, knock one and itl start to slide
in this whole damn world, there aint a place you can hide

cant go to dinner, cant see a motion film
even your commute to work could be the time that you are killed
you can get shot down while listening to rock music amplified
in this whole damn world, there aint a place you can hide

theres armies forming everywhere, they aint tied to sovereignty
they just people who hate others living free
it could be your neighbor, it could be a woman dressed like a bride
in this whole damn world, there aint a place you can hide

ideas polluting everyone, we all subscribe to some
some call to not hurt anyone, others to bang a battle drum
each gathering followers, getting stronger than the tide
in this whole damn world, there aint a place you can hide
