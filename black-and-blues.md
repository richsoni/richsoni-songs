its a hard road
its a hard and dicey road
that a man must take to be free

it takes a wild one
it takes a wild and crazy one
that wants noen but to be free

its a high stakes game that takes no pity
and lord it aint pretty if you loose
you could wise up
you could hush up
but if your like me youll risk the black and blues

when you hear dogs
when you hear dogs barkin
when you see cars parkin on your clay
will you take root
will you tear suits
or will you turn your boots and walk away

its a high stakes game that takes no pity
and lord it aint pretty if you loose
you could wise up
you could hush up
but if your like me youll risk the black and blues
