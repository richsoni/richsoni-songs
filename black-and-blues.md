It's a hard road
Its a hard and dicey road
That a man must take to be free

It takes a wild one
It takes a wild and crazy one
That wants none but to be free

It's a high stakes game that takes no pity
And lord it aint pretty if you loose
You could wise up
You could hush up,
but, if your like me you'll risk the black and blues

When you hear dogs
When you hear dogs barking
When you see cars parking on your clay
Will you take root
Will you tear suits,
or will you turn your boots and walk away

Its a high stakes game that takes no pity,
and lord it aint pretty if you loose
You could wise up
You could hush up,
but if your like me you'll risk the black and blues

Its a high stakes game that takes no pity,
and lord it aint pretty if you loose
You could wise up
You could hush up,
but if your like me you'll risk the black and blues

Its a high stakes game that takes no pity,
and lord it aint pretty if you loose
You could wise up
You could hush up,
but if your like me you'll risk the black and blues

It's a dark road
Its a dark and lonely road
That a man must take to be free

It takes a strong yell
You have to raise hell
To scare whats in the shadows in the trees

Its a high stakes game that takes no pity,
and lord it aint pretty if you loose
You could wise up
You could hush up,
but if your like me you'll risk the black and blues

It's a cold road
Its a cold and icey road
your guaranteed to slip couple dozen steps

Its a steep hill
When you slide will
You climb again after you catch your breath
