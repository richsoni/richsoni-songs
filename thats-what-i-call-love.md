g         a        d
when the eyes see their match
and the lips beg to attach
you sweet and forget, the treat
of the fire

And your home all alone
with your ear glued to the phone
oh babe
thats what i call love

----

When everything you used to hate
suddenly lost all of its weight
babe, i think i know whats going on with that thing pumpingbeyween your lungs 

You see their name written in the clouds
and their masquerader in the crowds
oh babe,
thats what i call love

---

When you know that all the stars,
Saturn Neptune and mars
couldn't hold all the happiness you feel

And, Zeus' Aphrodite would say
your bond is majestic and mighty
oh babe,
thats what i call love

---

Eclipsing sun and moon
clock hands at noon
seem askew when compared to you two together

You will lick each others wounds
make sure each others strings are tuned
oh babe,
thats what i call love

---

When you'd trade all 8 of your pawns
for that single queen to lean on
valiantly facing 16 foes alone, together

Through the ups and the downs
wearing straw hats or crowns
thats what I call love
