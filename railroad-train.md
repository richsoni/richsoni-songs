well, I always sit at the top of the rail road train
sittin down low just aint the same, lord
sittin down low just aint the same

I sit a-facin backward with the window by my side
starin at the fat words on the billboard signs

i dont think theres a better way, no lord
there aint no better way

well, I always sit at the top of the rail road train
sittin down low would drive me insane

I look into the citys as we stop at each
see the towns where teachers teach and the priests preach

i dont think theres a better way, no lord
there aint no better way

well, I always sit at the top of the rail road train
if all the seats are gone ill stand my friend

lookin in the woods as we go between towns
watchin rabbits, and the deer run all around

i dont think theres a better way, no lord
there aint no better way
