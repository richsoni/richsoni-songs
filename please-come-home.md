ive been waiting in the darkness all alone for so long
im thinkin im goin insane

ive got no idea when you'll come along
and wonder if my waiting is in vain

wont you please come home
im tired of chewing on my bone
if i wait any longer ill surly moan
wont you please come home

Im hungry, Im thirsty and I need you to help
aint nothin i can do without you

im restless, im wild and Im ready to yelp
i need some walkin time outside with you

wont you please come home
im tired of chewing on my bone
if i wait any longer ill surly moan
wont you please come home

oh oh head on back to our place
im aching and yearning your warm embrace


dont care what you did, who you saw
all i care is that you come back alright

I miss you I love you I want you right here
I want to snuggle and kiss you all night
