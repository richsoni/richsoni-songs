The devil and her mother
Rained it down on me
When I mentioned that her lover
Was seen kissing Nelly B

The devil and her mother
they raced across the room
pushed aside poor nelly
and sent johnny to his tomb

Mama this man,
He was doin' me wrong

The devil and her mother
they never tell no jokes
and if you tell one to them
your get your ankles broked

The devil and her mother
They like to tell their lies
but if you tell em yours
theyll scratch you in the eyes

Mama this man,
He was doin me wrong

The devil's icey father
Came rising from the sea
Saying whats become of Johnny?
Well, he laid with Nelly B.

Papa this man,
He was doin me wrong

The devil and her mother
To pay for what they've done
Where banished past the river
To the land where theres no sun

If you ride that river
With a full moon in the sky
You can her the devil whisper
Dear is that your guy
...

Mama that man,
He was doin me wrong
