title: Stormy Window
---

when you slammed the door
and left me all alone
kneeling on the floor
i couldnt help but moan

since youve been gone
ive been waitin
I want you to know
my wrist is restin
against a stormy window

you really shook me up
nothin seems the same
ive gut a tangle of guts
with a sinkin pain

you left me stranded
shakin, tired
bitter, weary, and low
ive been fearin the world
outside the stormy window

baby, darlin, honey, dear
i want you back with me here
birds a chirpin, sunshine a smilin
breezes blowin but im stuck a cryin
pushin my palms
against the stormy window

i know your gone for good
its settled into my mind
still the crack in my heart
is pounding colder than ice

ive gone crazy, ive gone nuts
why cant i just start a-hatin your guts
im bangin my head
on a stormy window
