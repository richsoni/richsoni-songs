title: Stormy Window
---

When you slammed the door  
And left me all alone  
Kneeling on the floor  
I couldn't help but moan  

Since you've been gone  
Ive been waitin'  
I want you to know  
My wrist is restin'  
Against a stormy window  

You really shook me up  
Nothin' seems the same  
Ive gut a tangle of guts  
With a sinkin' pain  

You left me stranded  
Shakin', tired  
Bitter, weary, and low  
Ive been fearin' the world  
Outside the stormy window  

Baby, darlin', honey, dear  
I want you back with me here  
Birds a chirpin', sunshine a smilin'  
Breezes blowin' but I'm stuck a cryin'  
Pushin' my palms  
Against the stormy window  

I know your gone for good  
Its settled into my mind  
Still the crack in my heart  
Is pounding colder than ice  

Ive gone crazy, I've gone nuts  
Why cant i just start a-hatin' your guts  
I'm bangin' my head  
On a stormy window
