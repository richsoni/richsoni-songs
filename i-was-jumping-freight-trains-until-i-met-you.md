title: I Was Jumping Freight Trains Until I Found You
---

i was sittin on the ghost line  
strummin out a lonesome chord  
never had so much time  
yet never been so bored  

i took my guitar, and painted its pick guard blue  
babe, i was jumping freight trains until i found you  

i traveled through the backwoods  
slept beneath the stars  
felt so lonesome as i stood  
alone in the engine yard  

i was lookin for an answer, but i didnt have a single clue  
babe, i was jumping freight trains until i found you  

ive been up all night with gamblers  
lost to aces backed with 8s  
shuffling all my colors  
but, couldnt get them straight  

i went face up with a pair of when I shouldve just withdrew  
babe, i was jumping freight trains until i found you  

on the rocky road to dublin  
i worked only to eat  
i couldnt find a place  
where I could rest my feet  

blurring my mind with good old mountain dew  
babe, i was jumping freight trains until i found you  

I was a lackey on a sailboat  
to a curly mustached pirate fixed on crime  
he was slitting innocent throats  
i was haulin the bow line  

i was just a member of a marooned and dirty crew  
babe, i was jumping freight trains until i met you  

i was shacking in gamorah  
watching the filth slither by  
washing feet for some poobuh  
while he made his daughters cry  

i just made out when the bridgestone began to acrue  
babe, i was jumping freight trains before i met you  

every time id find a road  
it would lead me astray  
bangin on a rusty compass  
trusting it to guide my way  

now its found a north thats true  
babe, i was jumping freight trains before i met you  

ever since we met  
the fog has drifted past  
i never will regret  
the love we have will ever last  

stickin by you side like rubber glue  
babe, i was jumping freight trains before i met you
