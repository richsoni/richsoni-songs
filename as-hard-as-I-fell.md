title: As Hard As I Fell
---

In the beginning, time took a pause  
Just faces grinning, apathetic to flaws  
But the clock struck its bell  
And upon the 8th day  
As slow as they fell  
'Sas slow as they rolled away  

She gave it another try, for old times sake  
She slipped out passed the guy, without makin' him wake  
It started so well  
When they she met him at the caf√©  
But as hard as she fell  
'Sas hard as she rolled away  

It came up real slow, with a warm feeling inside  
He felt it grow, like the rise of the tide  
Hes losing the swell  
And gets annoyed by the sway  
As slow as he fell  
Is as slow as he'll roll away  

Now I've learned my lesson, I've been burned several times  
Its no longer depressing, its the cost of tossing the dice  
Don't act misconstrued  
When I got nothin' to say  
As hard as I fall for you  
Is as hard as ill roll away
