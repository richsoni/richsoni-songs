title: As Hard As I Fell
---

in the beginning, time took a pause
just faces grinning, apathetic to flaws
but the clock struck its bell
and upon the 8th day
as slow as they fell
sas slow as they rolled away

she gave it another try, for old times sake
she slipped out passed the guy, without making him wake
it started so well
when they she met him at the cafe
but as hard as she fell
sas hard as she rolled away

it came up real slow, with a warm feeling inside
he felt it grow, like the rise of the tide
hes losing the swell
and gets annoyed by the sway
as slow as he fell
is as slow as he'll roll away

now ive learned my lesson, ive been burned several times
its no longer depressing, its the cost of tossing the dice
dont act misconstrued
when I got nothin to say
as hard as I fall for you
is as hard as ill roll away
