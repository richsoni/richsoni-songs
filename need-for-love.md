fools bolt like hermit crabs
from the raging flood in taxi cabs
but, darlin there aint nothin you can grab
to stab down the need for love

carpetbaggers, gypsy kings
the silver tongues of mermaids sing
conned the goldsmiths wives out of rings
to play on their need for love

swift feet of time walking slow
at the speed of two people who know
there aint no more steps in which they must go
to fulfill their need for love

they could name, any price
and I would pay it twice
just for a slice
we all need it, we all need it

romeo, paris, mr. mcbride
all feeding the fish on the coutryside
you aint alive until you have cried for 
someone that died from their need for love
