rockabilly millie is a shakin her tail
shes the type o girl that makes your knees feel frail
you want to squeeze her an hold her for the rest of your life
kiss her and snuggle her for the whole damn night
rockabilly millie shell give you a lick
make sure you remeber to checker for ticks

rockabilly millie is a girl that loves to eat
when your a cookin somethin up shes a stompin her feet
shell give a little howl when its time for a meal
she runs toward her plate like a tumblin wheel
rockabilly millie shell give you a lick
make sure you remeber to checker for ticks

when you are gone, she misses you so
she dont do nothin but sleep and watch the window
and when you come home shes happy as can be
shell be waiting at the door while your a turnin your key

rockabilly millie she aint you average chick
she likes the outdoors, hiking, carrying sticks
she dont care about mud or gettin dirty
shell run through the woods like a wild turkey
rockabilly millie shell give you a lick
make sure you remember to checker for ticks
