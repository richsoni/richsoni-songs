Rockabilly Millie is a shakin' her tail  
Shes the type of girl that makes your knees feel frail  
You want to squeeze her an hold her for the rest of your life  
Kiss her and snuggle her for the whole damn night  
Rockabilly Millie shell give you a lick  
Make sure you remember to checker for ticks  

Rockabilly Millie is a girl that loves to eat  
When your a cookin' somethin' up shes a stompin' her feet  
Shell give a little howl when its time for a meal  
She runs toward her plate like a tumblin' wheel  
Rockabilly Millie shell give you a lick  
Make sure you remember to checker for ticks  

When you are gone, she misses you so  
She don't do nothin' but sleep and watch the window  
And when you come home shes happy as can be  
Shell be waiting at the door while your a turnin' your key  

Rockabilly Millie she aint you average chick  
She likes the outdoors, hiking, carrying sticks  
She don't care about mud or gettin' dirty  
Shell run through the woods like a wild turkey  
Rockabilly Millie shell give you a lick  
Make sure you remember to checker for ticks
