C
Well I once was a rebel
F                    C
I was driven from my home
F               C
Hiding from the devil
Am                    G
In a pile of crumbled stone
C
Sleepin in the cargo
F                  C
To sail across the sea
F                      C
For the Land Of Broken Justice
Am            G        C
Was never the land for me

The brother was a coward
Sitting on the mountain high
He watched us bleed for hours
When the king came rolling by
I wouldn't lay my silver
On the name of any king
For The King Of Broken Justice
Was never a king to me

Hold my close my darling
Kiss me one more time
They'll take me in the morning
To leave my life behind
Walk me to the hemp rope
I know that it has to be
For the life of broken justice
Was never the life for me

Take the silver banjo
My uncle string for me
Cover it with rubble
Beside a willow tree
Fire off the cannon
Ring out the misery
For the song of broken justice
Was never the song for me
