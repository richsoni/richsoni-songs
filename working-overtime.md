title: Working Overtime
---

well Ive been under a guise
I can barely withstand
it feels like a crime

lying with my own green eyes
while Im tapping my hands
working overtime

working overtime,
I dont need the extra dime
there aint no reason or rhyme
when they make you work that overtime

I smile showing my teeth
while I stomach the drawl
but plunged deep down beneath
my pulse hammers the wall

I go to the bathroom
and sit down in the stall
Im locked up in a tomb
where the scorpions crawl


working overtime,
I dont need the extra dime
there aint no reason or rhyme
when they make you work that overtime

Whats the matter with you boy
tighten your tie up
we are going to go talk with the big cheese

slick back your hair, and use the biggest words you've got
lets drink our own champagne, and think outside the box

lets drink our own champagne, and think outside the box

well I dont make champagne, and I never slept in a box
so, can I go grab my train, and get out of these sox
I am quite sure today, Ive seen two of the same clocks.

working overtime,
I dont need the extra dime
there aint no reason or rhyme
when they make you work that overtime
