title: When I Make My Millions
---

When i make my millions, ro-da-do-do  
The devil will still be steppn' on the heel  
Of my shoe with his toe  

When i make my millions, ro-da-do-ray  
There'll still be a mod with pitch forks  
At the foot of my driveway  

When i make my millions, ro-da-do-me  
Ill still be a prisoner  
In this world ill never be free  

When i make my millions, ro-da-do-fa  
Ill still be a drifter  
On the run from the law  

When i make my millions, ro-da-do-so  
Ill still be so lonesome  
That don't change with some doe  

When i make my millions, ro-da-do-la  
Ill still be self conscious  
And want to withdraw  

When i make my millions, ro-da-do-ti  
Ill still be so lost  
Lookin' for the silver key  

When i make my millions, ro-da-do-do  
The devil will still be steppin' on the heel  
Of my shoe with his toe
