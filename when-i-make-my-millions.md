when i make my millions, ro-da-do-do
the devil will still be steppn on the heel
of my shoe with his toe

when i make my millions, ro-da-do-ray
ther'l still be a mod with pitch forks
at the foot of my driveway

---

when i make my millions, ro-da-do-me
ill still be a prisoner
in this world ill never be free

when i make my millions, ro-da-do-fa
ill still be a drifter
on the run from the law

---

when i make my millions, ro-da-do-so
ill still be so lonesome
that dont change with some doe

when i make my millions, ro-da-do-la
ill still be self conscious
and want to withdraw

---

when i make my millions, ro-da-do-ti
ill still be so lost
lookin for the silver key

when i make my millions, ro-da-do-do
the devil will still be steppn on the heel
of my shoe with his toe

when i make my millions, ro-da-do-do
ill still put on my jeans of blue
ill still keep drivin my rickety car
why change if they got me that far

when i make my millions, ro-da-do-ray
ill still shovel snow off my driveway
ill still drink down at the bar
why change if now ima star

when i make my millions, ro-da-do-me
ill still by a rake livin wild n free
ill still read a book right under a tree
why change if its workin for me

when i make my millions, ro-da-do-fa
ill never treat my self to the spa
ill never shave my beard into a fancy goatee
why change if its workin for me

---

when i make my millions, ro-da-do-so
ill still make sure ima nota movin too slow
ill still drink coffee late in the day
why change if i like it that way

when i make my millions, ro-da-do-la
ill still watch tv to get a hurrah
ill still take my guitar and strum and a play
why change if its fun at the end of the day

---

when i make my millions, ro-da-do-ti
ill still buy all of my groceries
ill still grill my steak till it gets all charred
why change if fancy foods are bizarre

when i make my millions, ro-da-do-do
ill still put on my jeans of blue
ill still keep drivin my rickety car
why change if they got me that far
