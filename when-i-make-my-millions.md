title: When I Make My Millions
---

when i make my millions, ro-da-do-do  
the devil will still be steppn on the heel  
of my shoe with his toe  

when i make my millions, ro-da-do-ray  
ther'l still be a mod with pitch forks  
at the foot of my driveway  

when i make my millions, ro-da-do-me  
ill still be a prisoner  
in this world ill never be free  

when i make my millions, ro-da-do-fa  
ill still be a drifter  
on the run from the law  

when i make my millions, ro-da-do-so  
ill still be so lonesome  
that dont change with some doe  

when i make my millions, ro-da-do-la  
ill still be self conscious  
and want to withdraw  

when i make my millions, ro-da-do-ti  
ill still be so lost  
lookin for the silver key  

when i make my millions, ro-da-do-do  
the devil will still be steppn on the heel  
of my shoe with his toe
