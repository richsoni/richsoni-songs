First time I saw her, was down in New Orleans
steeping a cure-all, of honey and Jimson weed
She sewed a mojo hand in the seam of my jean
did a little dance like a voodoo queen

ohhh ohh black rose
never near, but always close
face to face when the moonlight glows
feel the dawn, as her silhouette goes
oooh black rose

saw her gathering feathers, outside of stovepipe wells
wearing some leather, plated with terrapin shells
pricked my hand, pulled me under her spell
in the cool of the sand heard the spirits yell

ohhh ohh black rose
never near, but always close
face to face when the moonlight glows
feel the dawn, as her silhouette goes
oooh black rose

the last time I saw her was in the lake eerie fog
eyes in the water, i thought she was just a mirage
sitting low in the wake of the bog
emerging slow, floating like a god

ohhh ohh black rose
never near, but always close
face to face when the moonlight glows
feel the dawn, as her silhouette goes
oooh black rose
