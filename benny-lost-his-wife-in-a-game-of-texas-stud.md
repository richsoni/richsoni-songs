Benny lost his wife
In a game of Texas Stud

He had no more to loose
To the hand of Mr. Mudd

In his yard there was a garden
His true love she was there
Put her in the wagon
And they drove down to the square

Bonnie took the hand
Of the man she truly loved
And she left that Benny Gold
Without even one last hug

In his yard there was a garden
Benny burnt it bare
With shotgun in his wagon
He drove down to the square

Mudd he had a hand
Of aces flyin' high

He looked at Benny Gold
Straight in that suckers eye

His love was in the garden
She rigged that deck of cards
She knew that he would bargain
With the love that chained her heart

Standing in the square
Outside the Dog Saloon
Benny's got his gun
And Mudd can see his tomb

In his yard there was a garden
His true love she was there
Laying next to Mudd
With roses in her hair
