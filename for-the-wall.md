baby, im sitting on the back of a bus
theres a pregnant guy that smells like peanuts
i have to say i hate his guts

its crazy the way we arent living today
theve jetisoned our heros astray
we graduate and waste away

all and all is for the wall
for priests and the crowd to judge
no one seems to be into livin as much

baby i feel like i am getting old
the winter every year gets more cold
the summer dance just isnt as bold

last night i wished upon a shooting star
but later found it was a drone
sometimes i feel so alone

all and all is for the wall
for priests and the crowd to judge
no one seems to be into livin as much
