title: Molly, Do It Look Like I Care
---

I aint the guy who rides inside of Noah's Ark
I aint the guy who cries you must beware
God was looking at me
When he rose the great blues sea
But, Molly do it look like I care?

Looking through my second story window
Backwater rising from below
Bridges floating in the distance
Stuck here with no other place to go

I aint the guy who rides inside of Noah's Ark
I aint the guy who cries you must beware
God was looking at me
When he rose the great blues sea
But, Molly do it look like I care?

Brother Noah said he couldn't find me
Said i must have wandered off
But i heard him tip his toes behind me
Close the ship, and set it off
