---  

              G  
from the iron gates  
          C  
i can see outside  
                       D           G  
i can see the freight, trains pass by  
                 C  
and the day will come   
Walk down to Am  
i cannot even wait  
       g  c   g  
when a tap my drum  
       g  c   d  
outside these iron gates  

theres a crack in the wall  
I stash some paper within  
the screw turns back down the hall  
i jot down a poem  

and the day will come  
I cannot even wait  
when I tap on my drum  
outside these iron gates  

on these iron gates  
i clink my old cup  
i prentend its a bad dream  
and I cannot wake up  

and the day will come  
I cannot even wait  
when I tap on my drum  
outside these iron gates
