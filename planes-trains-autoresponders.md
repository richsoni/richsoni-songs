Feeling it all crashing down

Take me to an foreign city
exotic voices sound so pretty
asking if your from out of town

      who who yeah

up creeks
green cheeks
down on my luck

no sleep
time creeps
drown in the muck / scream what the fuck

tracing ceiling
chasing feelings
always dreaming about

Planes, Trains, Autoresponders
Cant count a second longer
Feeling it all crashing down

Take me to an foreign city
exotic voices sound so pretty
asking if your from out of town
