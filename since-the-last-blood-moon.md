Got your mojo bag  
With a rabbits foot  
Rattle snack rattle  
Bat wing soot  

Got yourself black book  
Brewed tea, read the leaves  
Flipping tarot cards  
Placing candles at your feet  

If your lookin' for salvation  
Don't expect it too soon  
Ive been toiling and waiting  
Since the last blood moon  

Prayin' up to Jesus  
Tiltin' your head tarred the sun  
When fold up all of your fingers  
Tightly twisting your thumbs  

If your lookin' for salvation  
Don't expect it too soon  
Ive been toiling and waiting  
Since the last blood moon  

You can furrow a shelter  
Crawl inside like a mouse  
Survive getting shucked by a twister  
Then suffocate under the house  


You can kill all the evil  
But know that more always grows  
Burn the forest down to a desert  
But still miss killing the crows  

If your lookin' for salvation  
Don't expect it too soon  
Ive been toiling and waiting  
Since the last blood moon
