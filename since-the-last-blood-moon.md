Tweak your mojo bag  
With a rabbits foot  
Rattle snack rattle  
Bat wing soot  

If your lookin' for salvation  
Don't expect it too soon  
Ive been toiling and waiting  
Since the last blood moon  

Got yourself black book  
Brewed tea, read the leaves  
Flipping tarot cards  
Placing candles at your feet  

If your lookin' for salvation  
Don't expect it too soon  
Ive been toiling and waiting  
Since the last blood moon  

Prayin' up to Jesus  
He will never come
fold up all of your fingers  
Twist together your thumbs  

If your lookin' for salvation  
Don't expect it too soon  
Ive been toiling and waiting  
Since the last blood moon  

You can kill all the evil  
But more always grows  
Burn the forest down
But spare the crows  

If your lookin' for salvation  
Don't expect it too soon  
Ive been toiling and waiting  
Since the last blood moon
