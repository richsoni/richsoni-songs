Well theres ghosts in the wire, ma  
listening when I speak  
Oh, theres ghosts in the wire, ma  
listening when I do speak  
It feels like a snitch  
A coward or a freak  

Theres a sound neath my bed, ma  
I feel like I cant get down  
Oh theres a sound neath my bed, ma  
I don't want to try to get down  
Get this monster out of my room  
I don't want him around  

Well theres eyes in my window, ma  
Watching while I sleep  
Oh, theres eyes in the window, ma  
Watching while I sleep  
Well it might be Osiris   
Judging all my sheep  

Theres a ghoul in the closet, ma  
Looking to find some bones  
Oh, theres a ghoul in the closet, ma  
Trying to score some bones  
Well, there aint no bones round here  
But, if there was they should leave em' alone  

Theres movement in my curtain, ma  
And, tonight there aint no wind  
My curtain is a movin', ma  
And, tonight theres not single gust of wind  
I pray it aint a vampire  
Tryin' to get me pinned  

Theres a witch in the tree, ma  
Laughing when I cry  
Oh theres a witch in the tree, ma  
She laughs each time I cry  
When I ask her whats so funny,  
She looks back real sly and says stop bein' shy
