title: Together
---

Oh my baby, I love her so
we go down, to the jersey shore
well get coffee, in the morning and bagels too
be on the parkway by 11, be on the beach by noon

as we grow up together
i know that well be forever
theres no one more perfect than me and you

my baby, my honey bear
you can call me snuggly bunches mccudikns and I dont care
we'll take our dogs for a walk in the park
we'll sit on a bench and we'll talk
some people will come by and say you too look so cute today
and we'll say we know
we already know

as we grow up together
i know that well be forever
theres no one more perfect than me and you

but days without your face seem so damn long
i love to hear your voice when we talk on the phone
but its not enough I need you here
I need you here in my arms

as we grow up together
i know that well be forever
well fair through any kind of weather
it will always be perfect you know its true-
