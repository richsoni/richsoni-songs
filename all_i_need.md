title: All I Need
---

I just cant wait for the evening
for you and I to watch some TV
I know youll make some popcorn
and snuggle up next to me

Well I just cant wait for the weekend
I just cant wait for two days with you
maybe we will sleep late
maybe we will make pancakes and bacon too

Uh huh, ok that is all i need to get through the day

I just cant wait for vacation
to explore a foreign land
we will take lots of pictures
and walk around holding hands

Well I just cant wait for the summer
To see the sunshine on your face
we can lay back one the beach
and listen to each other and the waves

Uh huh, ok that is all i need to get through the day

I just cant wait to retire
and spend each day with you
maybe well learn to play tennis
and teach our grandkids to tie their shoes

Uh huh, ok that is all i need to get through the day
