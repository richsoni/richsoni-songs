Don't cry, Don't cry  
Wipe away your tears cuz its a real good year to be alive  

Its alright, Its alright  
You'll wake up in the morning and forget all about tonight  

She does this every time and we don't really want to hear her wine  
She comes she drinks she laughs she cries she calls a cab and says goodnight  
And we don't want her to ruin our night  

Alright, Alright  
You'll wake up in the morning and forget all about tonight  

You do this every time and we don't really want to hear you wine  
You come you drink you laugh you cry you call a cab and say goodnight  
And we don't want you to ruin our night  

Shoe be do wap baa  
Shoe be do wap baa baa  

Shoe be do wap baa  
Shoe be do wap baa baa  

Shoe be do wap baa  
Shoe be do wap baa baa
