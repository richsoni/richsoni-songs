Em G C

Siren voice is screaming
cloven tail, hoof, and horn
all the midwives weeping
the Leeds devil's just been born

---

In the silt of Mulica River
on a dark and stormy eve
mother Leeds felt her haunches quiver
she wiped the sweat off with her sleeve

She was no rook to birthin' babies
having twelve within her brood
still she called all the local ladies
to do their dance and set the mood

---

There'd been whispers bout the father
for they knew Leeds was a drunk
some suspect it was another
for the mother too she was no monk

Some claim they saw her leaving
with a man in a dark cloak
after all the house was sleeping
they'd disappear in a cloud of smoke

---

They all gathered in a circle
smiled at the newborn in the room
but then their blood began to curdle
he contorted and his legs they grew and grew

The boy, they all had just been holding
now had a goats head and some claws
his eyes where red and they are bulging
his wingspan shred up all the gauze

---

Thrashing all about the cabin
he took his mothers fragile soul
through the chimney wings where flapping
knocking down the lightning pole

To this day if you wander
to far within the piney trees
beware of shadows moving yonder
pray to god to spare your knees
