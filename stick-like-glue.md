girl you know me
oh, for many years
long ago we
let our hearts eclipse and
ever since then its like

oh, a raging under toe
like oh, avalanches of snow
like oh, our love is strong its true
me and you stick like glue baby

always care free
we can just chill out for days
yet it still seems
like we zoomed to the moon
on a rocket ship

oh, a raging under toe
like oh, avalanches of snow
like oh, our love is strong its true
me and you stick like glue baby

who says that we
need to follow any rules
one day theyll see
that theyve been schooled by our love goin on like

its crazy, the way, the time keeps tick tocking by
i am certain you wont disagree, our love its still, still so strong

oh, a raging under toe
like oh, avalanches of snow
like oh, our love is strong its true
me and you stick like glue baby

oh, a raging under toe
like oh, avalanches of snow
like oh, our love is strong its true
me and you stick like glue baby
