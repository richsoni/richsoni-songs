Seven days, is way too long
I cant see your face, and baby thats so so wrong
I love you dear, Wish you where here

another week of goodbyes, more tears in our eyes
another week of sighs, on the lonely nights
but i love you dear, wish you where here

if i could run back home, find you in your room alone
pull you up into my arms keep you from the worlds harm
look you in the eyes and say....

oh its over now
what goes up always comes down
even when, even when, even when its not the best
I say amen I say amen because the both of us are blessed

another fight, baby thats not right
we went off like a kite, I could make it alright if I said
I love you dear, and thats sincere

now your walking away, and thats not ok
I really waant you to stay
but its too late to say
I love you dear, just stay here

if i could run back home, find you in your room alone
pull you up into my arms keep you from the worlds harm
look you in the eyes and say....

oh its over now
what goes up always comes down
even when, even when, even when its not the best
I say amen I say amen because the both of us are blessed

turn that frown upside down
make a sad song a happy sound
sometimes love comes around
lets turn this thing back around
sometimes even the best have a break down

oh its over now
what goes up always comes down
even when, even when, even when its not the best
I say amen I say amen because the both of us are blessed

oh its over now
what goes up always comes down
even when, even when, even when its not the best
I say amen I say amen because the both of us are blessed
