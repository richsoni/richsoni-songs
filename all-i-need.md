I just cant wait for the evening  
For you and I to watch some TV  
I know you'll  make some popcorn  
And snuggle up next to me  

Well I just cant wait for the weekend  
I just cant wait for two days with you  
Maybe we will sleep late  
Maybe we will make pancakes and bacon too  

Uh huh, ok that is all I need to get through the day  

I just cant wait for vacation  
To explore a foreign land  
We will take lots of pictures  
And walk around holding hands  

Well I just cant wait for the summer  
To see the sunshine on your face  
We can lay back one the beach  
And listen to each other and the waves  

Uh huh, ok that is all I need to get through the day  

I just cant wait to retire  
And spend each day with you  
Maybe well learn to play tennis  
And teach our grandkids to tie their shoes  

Uh huh, ok that is all I need to get through the day
