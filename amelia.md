your father was a railroad man
wine glass fixed in his hand
back then this land was their land
amelia

little red plane swishing by cries
rise above the rock island line
in the air your heart must fly
amelia

amelia watching her go
casting a shadow on the water below
singing a song on noahs great rainbow
how much they love you amelia youll never know

traveling with nothing except her wit
a hershey bar and two hankerchiefs 
all just to get a little more lift
amelia

smiling stepping onto the ground
flash photography all around
catching the queen of the air being crowned
amelia

spark so bright and wick so short
lonesome bessy the firehorse
realized that shell never soar
without amelia

every year on the fourth of july i hear a hollering in the sky
almost can see her wobbling by
amelia
